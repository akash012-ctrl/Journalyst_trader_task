# JavaScript to TypeScript Migration Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the migration process from JavaScript to TypeScript for the Trade Analytics Platform. TypeScript provides type safety, better code organization, and improved developer experience through static type checking.

## Migration Steps Completed

### 1. TypeScript Configuration

- Added `tsconfig.json` files to each server component:
  - broker-a-server
  - broker-b-server
  - main-server

### 2. Type Definitions

- Created type definitions in `main-server/src/types/`:
  - `trade.d.ts`: Defines interfaces for broker-specific trade data
  - `express.d.ts`: Contains Express-related type extensions

### 3. Type Guards Implementation

- Implemented type guards in `main-server/src/utils/typeGuards.ts`:
  - `isBrokerATrade`: Validates Broker A trade objects
  - `isBrokerBTrade`: Validates Broker B trade objects
  - `isBrokerATradeArray`: Validates arrays of Broker A trades
  - `isBrokerBTradeArray`: Validates arrays of Broker B trades
  - `hasRequiredTradeProperties`: Generic validation for required properties
  - `validateTradeData`: Processes and validates incoming trade data

### 4. Models Migration

- Converted model definitions to TypeScript:
  - `broker-a-server/models/trade.ts`
  - `broker-b-server/models/order.ts`
  - `main-server/models/*.ts`

### 5. Server Implementations

- Migrated Express server implementations from .js to .ts:
  - `broker-a-server/server.ts`
  - `broker-b-server/server.ts`
  - `main-server/server.ts` (alongside existing `server.js` for backward compatibility)

### 6. Routes and Middleware

- Converted routes to TypeScript:
  - Added type definitions for request and response objects
  - Implemented type checking for route handlers
- Added validation middleware in `main-server/middlewares/validationMiddleware.ts`

### 7. Services

- Migrated service layer to TypeScript:
  - `brokerService.ts`: Handles connections to broker APIs
  - `dataTransformationService.ts`: Transforms between broker-specific and unified formats
  - `llmService.ts`: Integrates with LLM APIs for analytics

## Benefits of the Migration

1. **Type Safety**: Early detection of type-related bugs
2. **Code Documentation**: Types serve as self-documentation
3. **IDE Support**: Improved autocompletion and intellisense
4. **Refactoring Support**: Safer refactoring with type checking
5. **API Consistency**: Enforced consistency between broker integrations
6. **Error Reduction**: Reduced runtime errors through compile-time checking

## Running the TypeScript Code

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run TypeScript with ts-node (for development)
npx ts-node server.ts
```

### Production

```bash
# Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
npm run build

# Run the compiled JavaScript
node dist/server.js
```
